# Using ANY.RUN for VMs

## VM Creation

to use ANYRUN, you ***must create an account outside of Glacier***.

Use a mobile device or another computer to *create* the account, then:

- Open ANY.RUN
- Login with your details
- Create a "New analysis" in Simple mode. It should look like this:

(p.s. anyrun vms last a max of 5 minutes, i reccomend triage but if this works for you it works)

### AnyRun's UI (Guide)

Anyrun's UI has 4 main seconds: The VM, Control Panel, HTTP Monitor, and Process Monitor.

You may ignore process/http monitor.

Controlling your VM is easy! In the top right, you can view how much time is left, and ***ADD MORE TIME*** to keep it from expiring.
