# Using ANY.RUN for VMs

1. Make a free account on ANY.RUN (Requires email verification)
3. Start an analysis of "google.com" in browser. Select your browser, OS (win 10), 60 SECONDS! and begin.

### AnyRun's UI

Anyrun's UI has 4 main seconds: The VM, Control Panel, HTTP Monitor, and Process Monitor.

You may ignore process/http monitor.

Controlling your VM is easy! In the top right, you can view how much time is left, and ***ADD MORE TIME*** to keep it from expiring.
