# Linuxzoo on Glacier

**Not reccomended as JSVNC is super buggy on UV**

Using linuxzoo is easy. To start, open up Linuxzoo.
We wont be focusing on anything but this top right panel

In this panel:
- Sign up and log in. (You may need to sign up on another device, as UV glitches when switching to "Register")
- Join the queue.
- Once in, select your OS and "switch on" your machine.
- Wait until `Machine State` is `RUN` and the boot is `completed`.
- Head to `connect` and under `Javascript VNC` click **VNC**
